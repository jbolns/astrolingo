**AstroLingo** aims to help develops to more easily launch and maintain multilingual personal websites, blogs, and portfolios using Astro.

It is based on Astro's [minimalistic blog template](https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/).

## Use cases
Using *AstroLingo* for single-language websites would be a bit of an overkill. Multilingual website are necessarily more complex than single-language ones. 

That said, if you need or want a multilingual personal website, blog, or portfolio, *AstroLingo* can save you many hours of work; days, even.

## Guidance
To keep things simple, **AstroLingo** relies on Astro's standard structure and underlying functionality.

If you understand the structure of a typical Astro project, you will likely find AstroLingo quite easy to understand.

Head to [*AstroLingo*'s GitHub repository](https://github.com/jbolns/astrolingo) for detailed guidance.
